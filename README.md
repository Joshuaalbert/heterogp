# heterogp
Provides a heteroscedastic noise latent for a sparse variational Gaussian process using GPflow

## WARNING
Currently, this project is out of date as I finish up my PhD. 
It is actually sitting in a nearly rewritten state on my laptop, and it needs to be updated to work with the latest GPFlow.

## Promises
I will release a type-set document that describes how heteroscedasticity is handled here.
I will provide a heteroscedastic version of GPR, and SGPR.
