# heterogp
Provides a heteroscedastic noise latent for a sparse variational Gaussian process using GPflow

## WARNING
Currently, this project is out of date as I finish up other work. 
It is actually sitting in a much more finished and rewritten state on my laptop that would be useful for studies with heteroscedasticity. 
I will make it accessible when time permits! So stay tuned.
